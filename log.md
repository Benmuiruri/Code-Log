### Day 1: 7 February 2021
##### (To Do)
- Setting up HTML and CSS Linters in the Hello Microverse Project
- Learning the Github Flow for professional software development
- Request a Code Review 
- Learn the HTML Box Model 

**Notes of Today's Progress**
- I learned quite alot about the Box model, now box-sizing: border-box makes sense. 


**Questions from Today's Work**
- Which is best practice? Using "git add ." or "git add index.html"? 
- how to record what you learn
- How do you check quiz accuracy

**Resources/Links**
- [CSS Reset link] (https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/)

**Random Thoughts**
- It's a skill reading error messages and taking a moment to think about the error. Not just rushing to look for the answer or getting frustated by an error. Every error has a solution. 
- Excited to have received my first Code Review. The reviewer left no comment which makes me doubt how much "review" was done to my code.
