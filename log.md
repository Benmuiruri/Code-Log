### Day 1: 7 February 2021
##### (To Do)
- Setting up HTML and CSS Linters in the Hello Microverse Project
- Learning the Github Flow for professional software development
- Request a Code Review 
- Learn the HTML Box Model 

**Notes of Today's Progress**
- I learned quite alot about the Box model, now box-sizing: border-box makes sense. 


**Questions from Today's Work**
- Which is best practice? Using "git add ." or "git add index.html"? 
- how to record what you learn
- How do you check quiz accuracy

**Resources/Links**
- [CSS Reset link](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/)

**Random Thoughts**
- It's a skill reading error messages and taking a moment to think about the error. Not just rushing to look for the answer or getting frustated by an error. Every error has a solution. 
- Excited to have received my first Code Review. The reviewer left no comment which makes me doubt how much "review" was done to my code.

### Day 2: 16 February 2021
##### (To Do)
- Write the desktop version CSS for my portfolio project.

**Notes of Today's Progress**
- I was able to write the desktop version CSS for the header section and hero section CSS 

**Questions from Today's Work**
- I did not have any questions for today.
**Resources/Links**
- [Excellent article explaining CSS Responsiveness by A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/)

**Random Thoughts**
- I learned that writing mobile first code is more efficient, there is less repetition. Going forward I will be writing mobile first code. 
- I am slowly starting to know what to do when I want to style things. A week ago I could not think for myself what could be done. I used to check other people's code. At least now, I know what to do, I just reference how to do it. In a couple of weeks I will be able to style elements just by writing it out.
- The microverse journey is great so far, but I have not adjust 100% on the fast pace. My time management needs some work. That's the reason why I have not being updating my daily log because "I dont have time." I will definitely work on that.

### Day 8: 17 February 2021
##### (To Do)
- I updated my github README
- Finished the desktop version CSS and the project was approved
**Notes of Today's Progress**
- Decent progress today. From morning I knew that today was not going to be a tough day. Although I understimated how long it would take me to finish the web-version CSS. It took longer because I had written not the very best of mobile CSS.


**Questions from Today's Work**
- No questions today. 

**Resources/Links**
- Mainly relied on MDN

**Random Thoughts**
- It feels nice to complete a project successfully. I like how I am learning how to do things properly. 
- One reviewer said my code was one of the best ones... That was nice to hear.
